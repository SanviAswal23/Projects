Projects Repository

Welcome to my Projects repository! This repo contains various projects I've built to improve my skills in web development and programming.

Whatâ€™s inside?

Basic Portfolio Website: A personal site showcasing my skills and projects.

Simon Says Game: A classic memory game built to practice JavaScript and UI interactions.

Todo App: A React-based task manager that helps organize daily tasks with categories.

These projects have helped me grow as a developer by applying concepts like React, JavaScript, and UI/UX design. I'm continually learning and improving, and many more exciting projects are on the way!
